## Day-1: JavaScript

### JavaScript Interview Questions for Full-Stack Developers

This section contains **15 essential JavaScript interview questions** categorized into **basic** and **advanced** concepts.

### Basic JavaScript Questions

1. **Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.**

   - When would you use each, and why?

2. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

   - Why is strict equality (`===`) preferred?

3. **What are JavaScript data types?**

   - Explain the difference between `undefined`, `null`, and other primitive types.

4. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**

   - Provide an example and describe a real-world use case.

5. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

   - Explain how `this` behaves in different contexts (e.g., global scope, object methods, arrow functions).

6. **What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?**

   - How do arrow functions differ from regular functions?

7. **What are promises in JavaScript?**

   - Explain how promises work and the difference between `.then()` and `async/await`.

8. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

   - How do you check for both in JavaScript?

9. **What are JavaScript events, and how do you handle them?**

   - Explain event bubbling and event delegation with examples.

10. **What is the DOM in JavaScript, and how do you manipulate it?**
    - Provide examples of common DOM manipulation methods.

    - Explain the different phases of the event loop and how asynchronous operations are handled.

12. **What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?**

    - How does it differ from classical inheritance? Provide examples.

13. **How does JavaScript handle memory management?**

    - Explain garbage collection, memory leaks, and strategies to avoid them.

14. **What are JavaScript modules?**

    - Explain the difference between ES6 modules and CommonJS. How do you import/export functionality?

15. **What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?**
    - Provide examples and explain their use cases in real-world applications.

## Preparation Plan

- Each day will focus on one critical area of full-stack development (e.g., **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Databases**, etc.).
- Day-by-day topics will include both theoretical concepts and hands-on coding practice.
